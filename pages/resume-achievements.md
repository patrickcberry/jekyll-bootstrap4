### Team Management
**Veolia:**

Over the course of 10 year built up an electrical and controls team from zero to
nine. Over this period have seen very little staff turnover (only a single staff
member has left the team and this was a transfer to another Veolia division).

Have implemented a successful Electrical Engineering Internship Program which
commenced in 2017 for Electrical and Software Engineering students.

**Serck Controls:**

I managed the Serck Controls Sydney office from 2006 until 2008. During this
period staff turnover was exceptionally low and we also managed to grow the
size of the team even though this was the peak of the mining boom.

### Engineering Management

### Change Management
**OT and Industrial Cybersecurity:**

Was successful in having an OT and Industrial Cybersecurity function added to
the electrical engineering team at Veolia.

**Hubgrade:**

The electrical engineering team inherited an internal system called Hubgrade as
part of bringing all Veolia's Australian operations under common management.

The Hubgrade system had a flawed business model with no current or foreseeable
revenue.

I initiated a review of the system and recommended that the system be disbanded
(which was approved).

I managed the redeployment and redundancy of affected staff.
