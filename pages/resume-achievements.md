### Team Management
**Veolia:**

Over the course of 10 year built up an electrical and controls team from zero to
nine. Over this period have seen very little staff turnover (only a single staff
member has left the team and this was a transfer to another Veolia division).

Have implemented a successful Electrical Engineering Internship Program which
commenced in 2017 for Electrical and Software Engineering students.

**Serck Controls:**

I managed the Serck Controls Sydney office from 2006 until 2008. During this
period staff turnover was exceptionally low and we also managed to grow the
size of the team even though this was the peak of the mining boom.

### Engineering Management

**Veolia standards:**

Implementation of a set of Veolia engineering standards covering electrical
engineering, instrumentation and control systems.

**PLC / SCADA Library:**

Implemented a library standard PLC and SCADA function blocks for reuse across
multiple Veolia sites. The benefits of use a standard library include,
- Reduced engineering time
- Consistent operator interface between sites
- Reduced testing and commissioning time (due to the reuse of standard, tested components)

**Cybersecurity Audits:**

Managed the cybersecurity audits of industrial control systems at Veolia's Australian
sites as part of a global audit program.

### Shutdown Management
**Norske Skog Albury PM shutdown:**

The control system upgrade of newsprint machine at the Norske Skog Paper Mill
in Albury included two shutdowns. The second shutdown was very successful with
the machine being handed back to operations after nine days when 14 was scheduled.

### Change Management
**OT and Industrial Cybersecurity:**

Was successful in having an OT and Industrial Cybersecurity function added to
the electrical engineering team at Veolia.

**Hubgrade:**

The electrical engineering team inherited an internal system called Hubgrade as
part of bringing all Veolia's Australian operations under common management.

The Hubgrade system had a flawed business model with no current or foreseeable
revenue.

I initiated a review of the system and recommended that the system be disbanded
(which was approved).

I managed the redeployment and redundancy of affected staff.

### Business Process Improvement
**Operational Data Management System (ODMS) project:**

Proposed the implementation of an enterprise historian for the management
and reporting of process operational data in Veolia and managed it's
implementation.

See, [Operational Data Management System](/projects/Operational%20Data%20Management%20System.html)

**Bulk Waste Tracking System:**

Specified and implemented a web based system to track bulk waste from Veolia
transfer stations in Sydney to disposal location at Woodlawn.

See, [Waste Tracking System](/projects/Waste%20Tracking%20System.html)

**Service agreements:**

Have negotiated various service agreements and standing offer consultancy
agreements while at Veolia.

**Quotation management system:**

Implementation of quotation templates and support materials, including
quotation management and approval system at Serck Controls and MIPAC.

### Business Development
Diversified client base at Serck Controls from utilities only into manufacturing (Fletcher Building & CoreGas).

Pulp and Paper Account Manager at Serck Controls.
