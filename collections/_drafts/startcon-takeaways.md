#### StartCon 2018 Sydney Takeaways

I attended StartCon 2018 in Sydney which was held on the 30th November and 1st
December at the
[Royal Randwick Racecourse](https://www.australianturfclub.com.au/royal-randwick/).

... well organized event ... congratulate organizers

... multiple stages so did not see all presentations

... My position is that considering a technology startup as a career change ...

... My key takeaways ....

##### Vibrant Community
... 4000 attendees

... significant investment


... growth in vendors is significant

### Inovative Work

... pitch competition finalists ...

I must say I love the by-line for [Daitum](https://www.daitum.com/), Big decisions not big data. Brilliant!

##### Conferences are a waste of time :-(
... stat that less than 10% of people will apply anything that they have learnt at a conference

##### Best technology is the one you know

##### Architecture vs MVP
