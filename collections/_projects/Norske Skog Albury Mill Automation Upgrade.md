overview:
  - Lead Project Engineer for paper machine controls upgrade.

role:
  - Lead Project Engineer

description:
  - Norske Skog engaged MIPAC to upgrade the existing control systems site wide
    from a number of legacy platforms to the Metso DNA DCS.
  - My role was a Lead Project Engineer responsible for the upgrade of the
    control systems of the Paper Machine. Managed a team performing the design,
    construction management and commissioning for the upgrade.
  - The upgrade involved replacing a mixture of Honeywell TDC2000, TDC3000,
    Siemens S5 and S7 PLCs and relay logic with a Metso DNA DCS.
  - The Albury Mill is a single paper machine site, so work on the PM is
    critical as it represent the only source of revenue.
