description:
   - Veolia's Horsley Park Waste Management Facility is located within the
     Austral Brick site in Horsley Park in the Western Suburbs of Sydney.
   - The facility accepts waste directly from commercial and council customers,
     as well as receiving residual material from other Veolia facilities.
   - With the facility coming to end of operational life in 2018 or 2019 the
     site will be capped and no long accepting waste. After the site is capped,
     Veolia will still have ongoing responsibility to manage leachate, storm
     water, landfill gas and monitor odour for an extended period of time.
   - This project aims to improve operational efficiency by allowing for
     remote monitoring of the site, saving travel time of the waste operational
     staff.
