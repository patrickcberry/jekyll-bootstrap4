overview:
  - Online waste tracking system to track the movement of bulk waste from Veolia's transfer stations to Tarago (Woodlawn) treatment and disposal locations.

role:
  - Project Manager, Developer (Angular, Liferay (Java), Pentaho, SQL Server)

description:
  - Veolia operate two transfer stations in Sydney (Clyde and
    Banksmeadow) where waste is loaded into shipping containers and
    transported by rail to the Woodlawn Bio-precinct (Southeast of Goulburn).
  - At Woodlawn, the waste is disposed of in either a Mechanical Biological
    Treatment Plant or a Landfill Bioreactor.
  - Veolia has made contractual commitments with certain customers to
    meet landfill diversion targets. To verify that these diversion
    targets are meet, an application was required to track the compacted from certain customers to final disposal location.
  - During 2017 and 2018 a pilot system was developed which has been a success.
  - This project rebuilds the pilot system to a production quality application and incorporates additional features as listed below;

description-list:
  - Receive and process weighbridge data from corporate ERP system (reimplemented in Pentaho)
  - File transfers from PLC to application server (processing implemented in Pentaho)
  - mySQL database migrated to Microsoft SQL server
  - Nodejs application server rebuilt as a Liferay Portlet
  - Web application rebuilt in Liferay
  - RFID tags added to containers and scanners to compactors and container handlers
  - Compactor handlers fitted with in-cab information display units
  - Rail manifest generation added
  - Reporting features expanded

description-post-list:
  - The pilot is planned to be implemented during 2018 and 2019.

challenges:
  - This project includes several unfamiliar technologies. Which include,
challenges-list:    
  - RFID tags and readers
  - Liferay Portal
  - Mobile applications
  - Angular
challenges-post-list:
