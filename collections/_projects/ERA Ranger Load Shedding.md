overview:
  - Implementation of load shedding system.

role:
  - Electrical Engineer

description:
  - Veolia operates the water treatment plant at the ERA Ranger mine at Jabiru in the Northern Territory.
  - Electricity for the water treatment plant is generated on site with diesel generators and has a power network that is independent of the rest of the site.
  - The water treatment plant had been experiencing regular power outages due to
    a combination of mechanical unreliability of the diesel engines and
    instability of the power system.
  - The scope of this project included,
description-list:
  - Working with the site operations team and equipment suppliers to improve the reliability of the diesel engines
  - Improve the online monitoring of the engines to better predict failures
  - Implement a load shedding system to prevent an engine trip cascading to a site wide power outage
  - Improve the load management controls
